LATEST FOREIGN KEY ERROR
------------------------
2016-07-24 04:50:52 4d4 Error in foreign key constraint creation for table `universitydb`.`offers`.
A foreign key constraint of name `universitydb`.`CourseID`
already exists. (Note that internally InnoDB adds 'databasename'
in front of the user-defined constraint name.)
Note that InnoDB's FOREIGN KEY system tables store
constraint names as case-insensitive, with the
MySQL standard latin1_swedish_ci collation. If you
create tables or databases whose names differ only in
the character case, then collisions in constraint
names can occur. Workaround: name your constraints
explicitly with unique names.
